# Deepfake_Detection
A deepfake detection project aims to develop and implement machine learning models and techniques to identify manipulated or synthesized media, such as images or videos, where artificial intelligence technologies are used to convincingly replace or superimpose one person's likeness onto another's. The project's goal is to detect the presence of such deceptive content to help combat misinformation, fraudulent activities, and protect against privacy breaches.
